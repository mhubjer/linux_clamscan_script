This script will immediately run ClamAV for you and begin scanning your computer for any malware. 
If found, it will automatically add the locations of these suspicious files into a text file for you to review. 
Make sure that you create a folder labeled "CLAMSCAN_LOGS" on your Desktop. If the folder is to have a different label,
make sure that the script is edited to reflect the changes. Otherwise, have fun with it!
